Our diploma is recognized by members of the [U4 Group of GitHub Research Universities](https://github.com/U4Group); 
and probably all the McDonald's with a [working ice-cream machine](https://mcbroken.com/).

Oh wow, what a coincidence — the diploma just happens to look a little bit familiar, like, say, the [University of Illinois](https://purdont.cc) and UCLA. 
Totally normal, because great minds think alike, right?
