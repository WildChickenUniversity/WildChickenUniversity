## Chicken CANT TYPE

so we asked ChatGPT (probably 3.5) to write the following paragraph for us:   
(I mean, OpenAI should create a [ChickenGPT](https://cybernews.com/tech/catgpt-chatbot-that-meows-everything/) for us)

Welcome to Wild Chicken University, the premier institution for all your poultry-related needs. Our world-renowned faculty of chicken experts will teach you everything you need to know about these feathery friends, from their clucking communication to their delectable taste (just kidding, we don't eat our students).

At Wild Chicken University, we pride ourselves on being the only university where you can major in "Chickenology." Yes, that's right, a whole degree dedicated to the study of chickens. Don't believe us? Just ask our esteemed faculty, including Professor Peck-a-boo, Professor Coop de Ville, and Professor Eggbert.

We offer a wide range of courses, from "How to Train Your Chicken to Play Chess" to "The Art of Chicken Dressage." Our state-of-the-art facilities include a chicken playground, a chicken spa, and a chicken talent show stage.

If you're tired of the traditional university application process, don't worry. At Wild Chicken University, we don't care about your GPA, test scores, or extracurricular activities. All we care about is your love for chickens. So come join us, and let's cluck our way to academic success!

## Enough BS, WTF is wcu?

Wild Chicken University (also known as a diploma mill or degree mill) is an organization that awards academic degrees and diplomas with substandard or no academic study and without recognition by official educational accrediting bodies. The purchaser can then claim to hold an academic degree, and the organization is motivated by making a profit. These degrees are often awarded based on vaguely construed life experience. Some such organizations claim accreditation by non-recognized/unapproved accrediting bodies set up for the purposes of providing a veneer of authenticity. While the terms "degree mill" and "diploma mill" are commonly used interchangeably, within the academic community a distinction is sometimes drawn: 

- A "degree mill" issues "real" diplomas from non regionally accredited "universities", which may be legal in some states but are generally illegitimate universities. 
- A "diploma mill" issues counterfeit diplomas which bear the names of legitimate universities.

## 寫在最後

我很意外你有看到這裏 :) 

原始版本的 Wild Chicken University [「官網」](https://old.wcu.edu.pl)是修改自 Northwestern University 的錄取結果頁面，當年被拒之後覺得很好玩就做了這個網站。

官網的內容經過數次填充和修改成了現在的模樣。雖然並不認爲會有人真的仔細去閱讀，我依舊在字裏行間埋藏了許多有趣的內容。
作爲一個玩笑，WCU 達成了我製作他的初衷。雖然做工粗糙，但我很開心大家可以通過 WCU 收穫快樂，也希望能夠讓暫時沒有 offer 的朋友們 feel better。

Best Wishes
