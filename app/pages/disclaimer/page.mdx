#### §2.2 Elements of Our Logo

##### §2.2.1 Fish Motif
  
Taken from Hungary Town [Mesztegnyő's](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coa_Hungary_Town_Mesztegny%C5%91.svg) coat of arms.

> This file depicts the official coat of arms or flag of a Hungarian municipality. According to 1.§ (4) of the Hungarian copyright law (1999./LXXVI.), 
copyright protection does not cover "legal provisions, other means of state direction, court and other official resolutions, announcements and 
documents issued by an authority or other official organ, as well as standards made obligatory by law and other similar regulations." Official 
coat of arms and flags, being defined in such a regulation, are thus in the public domain in Hungary, and also in the US, according to § 313.6(C)(2) 
Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, 3rd ed. 2014 (Compendium (Third)): "As a matter of longstanding public policy, the U.S. Copyright
Office will not register a government edict that has been issued by any state, local, or territorial government, including legislative enactments,
judicial decisions, administrative rulings, public ordinances, or similar types of official legal materials. Likewise, the Office will not register 
a government edict issued by any foreign government or any translation prepared by a government employee acting within the course of his or her official duties."
