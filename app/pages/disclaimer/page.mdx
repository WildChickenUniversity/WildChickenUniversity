The logo utilized herein is derived from the University of Pennsylvania and is presented for parody and illustrative purposes only. The accompanying signature—attributed to Colonel Harland David Sanders, founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken—serves as a satirical embellishment consistent with our self-styled identity as a “chicken university.”

The fish on the logo is from Hungary Town [Mesztegnyő's](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coa_Hungary_Town_Mesztegny%C5%91.svg) Coat of Arm. According to 1.§ (4) of the Hungarian copyright law (1999./LXXVI.) official coat of arms and flags, being defined in such a regulation, are thus in the public domain in Hungary, and also in the US, according to § 313.6(C)(2) Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, 3rd ed. 2014 (Compendium (Third))

Likewise, the daisy flower on the logo is from DEU [Marienfeld (Westf.)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DEU_Marienfeld_(Westf.)_COA.svg) Coat of Arm. According to § 5 Abs. 1 of the German Copyright law, official works like coats of arms are in the public domain.
