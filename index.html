        <p>
          Wild Chicken University (also known as a diploma mill or degree
          mill) is an organization that awards academic degrees and diplomas
          with substandard or no academic study and without recognition by
          official educational accrediting bodies. The purchaser can then
          claim to hold an academic degree, and the organization is motivated
          by making a profit. These degrees are often awarded based on vaguely
          construed life experience. Some such organizations claim
          accreditation by non-recognized/unapproved accrediting bodies set up
          for the purposes of providing a veneer of authenticity. While the
          terms "degree mill" and "diploma mill" are commonly used
          interchangeably, within the academic community a distinction is
          sometimes drawn: <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            A "degree mill" issues "real" diplomas from non regionally
            accredited "universities", which may be legal in some states but
            are generally illegitimate universities.
          </li>
          <li>
            A "diploma mill" issues counterfeit diplomas which bear the
            names of legitimate universities.
          </li>
        </ul>
